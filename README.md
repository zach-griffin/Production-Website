# My Website
The following code is the source code for my website, zgriffin.com

The purpose of this site is to redirect you, the user, to my main LinkedIn profile. I keep my LinkedIn updated therefore serves as a more interactive version of a resume. The redirection is purposely slow, to allow the user time to understand where they are being redirected to, and not blindly take to a different page.
